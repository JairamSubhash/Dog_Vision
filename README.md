# Dog_Vision

This project focuses on identifying dog breeds from input images using deep learning techniques. We developed a model to cater to real-world scenarios where users seek instant breed recognition. Through exploratory data analysis (EDA), we gained insights into dataset characteristics, breed distribution, and potential challenges. The model's performance was assessed on test data to ensure its effectiveness.

Key Features:

Developed a deep learning model using TensorFlow 2.0 and Keras.

Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand dataset characteristics.

Evaluated model performance on test data for real-world applicability.

Utilized Google Colab for seamless collaboration and execution.
